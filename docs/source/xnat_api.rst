`Rxnat <https://neuroconductor.org/tutorials/rxnat>`_ is an R package to facilitate connecting to, querying, and downloading from XNAT.  

It is installed for all users on Synapse. Elsewhere, you can install Rxnat from neuroconductor with:

.. code-block:: console

   source("http://neuroconductor.org/neurocLite.R")
   neuro_install("Rxnat", release = "stable")

Alternatively, you can install it from GitHub with:

.. code-block:: console
