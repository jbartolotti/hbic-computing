KUMC Username is written in the User field. KUMC Password is written in the password field. An X is hand-drawn through the register button. A hand-drawn circle is around the login button.

On the next page, link your LDAP account (that is, your KUMC account) with a New XNAT Account. On the right hand pane, name your XNAT account FirstInitialLastname (you'll still always sign in with your KUMC account, this XNAT username is only used internally by the application), provide your name and email, and submit.
